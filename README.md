# PendingNameEngine2

This 3D Engine is created by two students from Barcelona for the subject of 3D Engines. 
The github repository page is: https://github.com/GuillemD/PendingNameEngine2

Version 1.0 allows the user to drag and drop FBX files to load geometry and also drop textures (.png,.dds) to use on those models.

It has Unity-like camera controls:
- RMB + 'WASD' to move around the space
- Mouse wheel to Zoom IN/OUT
- ALT + LMB to orbit an object
- 'F' to focus camera to selected game object.
- HOLD SHIFT increases camera speed

In the Main menu, you have several features:
- Saving configuration
- Show/Hide configuration panel -> ( information about performance, debug functionalities)
- Inspector panel to show geometry properties of a selected game object
- Hierarchy Panel displaying all the game objects in a tree (also able to delete all scene game objects)
- Show/hide console
- Create primitives using par_shapes
- Random number generator
